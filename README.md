# @mapbox/underreact

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **WORK IN PROGRESS!** ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

Minimal, extensible React app build system that you won't need to eject when things get weird.

It's a pretty thin wrapper around Babel, Webpack, and PostCSS, and will never accumulate an ecosystem of its own. And it aims to be just as useful for production applications with idiosyncratic demands as for simple prototypes.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Node 6+.

Install Underreact as a developer dependency of your project:

```
npm install -D @mapbox/underreact
```

If you are building a react application, you also need to install react dependencies:

```
npm install react react-dom
```

Add `_underreact*` to your `.gitignore`, and maybe other ignore files (e.g. `.eslintignore`). That way you'll ignore files that Underreact generates. (If you set the [`outputDirectory`] option, you'll want to do this for your custom value.)

### Getting started

**The bare minimum to get started with Underreact.**

- Create your entry JS file at `src/entry.js`.

```js
// src/entry.js
console.log('hello world!');
```

- Run it with `underreact`

```bash
npx underreact start 
# or 
node node_modules/.bin/underreact start
```

- Open the URL printed in your terminal.

**Using with react**

- Create your entry JS file at `src/entry.js`.

```jsx
// src/entry.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello world</div>;
  }
}

const container = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(container);
ReactDOM.render(<App />, container);
```

- Run it with `underreact`

```bash
npx underreact start
```

- Open the URL printed in your terminal.

## Usage

You should not install the Underreact CLI globally. Instead, install it as a dependency of your project and use the `underreact` command via  `npx`, npm `"scripts"`, or `node_modules/.bin/underreact`. The easiest way is probably to set up npm scripts in `package.json`, so you can use `npm run start`, `npm run build`, etc., as needed.

The CLI provides the following commands:

- `start`: Start a development server.
- `build`: Build for deployment.
- `serve-static`: Serve the files that you built for deployment.

All commands look for `underreact.config.js` in the current working directory.

### Defining your HTML

Underreact is intended for single-page apps, so you only need one HTML page. Your JavaScript needs to use `react-dom` to render your application component into the HTML.

You have 2 choices:

- **Preferred:** Write a JS module exporting a function that returns an HTML string or a Promise that resolves with an HTML string. Put it at `src/html.js` (the default) or point to it with the [`htmlSource`] configuration option.
- Provide no HTML-rendering module and let Underreact create a default document. *You should only do this for prototyping and early development*: for production projects, you'll definitely want to define your own HTML at some point, if only for the `<title>`.

In your JS module, you can use JS template literals to interpolate expressions, and you can use any async I/O you need to put together the page. For example, you could read JS files and inject their code directly into `<script>` tags, or inject CSS into `<style>` tags. Or you could make an HTTP call to fetch dynamic data and inject it into the page with a `<script>` tag, so it's available to your React app.

The function exported by your JS module will be passed a context object with the following properties:

- `renderJsBundles`: **You must use this function to add JS to the page.** Typically you'll invoke it at the end of your `<body>`. It adds the `<script>` tags that pull in Webpack bundles.
- `renderCssLinks`: **You must use this function to add CSS to the page,** unless your only sources of CSS are `<link>`s and `<style>`s that you write directly into your HTML. It will add CSS compiled from the [`stylesheets`] option and also any CSS that was created through other Webpack plugins you added.
- `siteBasePath`: The [`siteBasePath`] you set in your configuration (or the default).
- `publicAssetsPath`: The [`publicAssetsPath`] you set in your configuration (or the default).
- `production`: Whether or not the HTML is being built in production mode. You may want to use this, for example, to decide whether or not to minify JS or CSS you are inlining into the HTML.

Here's an example of what an HTML-rendering module might look like:

```js
'use strict';

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const minimizeJs = require('./minimize-js');

module.exports = ({ renderJsBundles, renderCssLinks, production }) => {
  let inlineJs = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, './path/to/some-script.js'));
  if (production) {
    inlineJs = minimizeJs(inlineJs);
  }

  const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no">
      <title>Words that rhyme with fish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A website about words that rhyme with fish, like plish">
      <link href="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-assembly/v0.21.2/assembly.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
      ${renderCssLinks()}
      <script async defer src="https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-assembly/v0.21.2/assembly.js"></script>
      <script>${inlineJs}</script>
    </head>

    <body>
      <div id="app">
        <!-- React app will be rendered into this div -->
      </div>
      ${renderJsBundles()}
    </body>

    </html>
  `;

  return html;
};
```
